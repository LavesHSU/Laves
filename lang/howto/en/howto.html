<h2>HowTo: Work with LAVES</h2>
A typical workflow in LAVES follows to simplify the "getting started" (please pay attention to the tips and hints at the end of the section too):
<ol>
<li>
<b>Select one of the installed algorithms.</b><br>
Press "New" (<img src="../images/new.png">) and select an algorithm from the list. Tip: Use the search field to find your algorithm easily.
Beside additional information about the selected algorithm there are displayed preferences you can use to determine properties of the algorithm.
</li>
<li>
<b>Create a problem entity.</b><br>
<i>Example</i>: Your selected algorithm approaches a problem of graph theory.<br>
First create a graph in the corresponding view that is used to apply the algorithm. Use the options to add vertices (<img src="../images/vertex_add.png">) and edges (<img src="../images/edge_add.png">) or change their properties (<img src="../images/properties.png">).
</li>
<li>
<b>Determine the execution mode.</b><br>
If the selected algorithm provides an exercise mode you can activate it (<img src="../images/exercise_mode.png">) but before you start the algorithm. The exercise mode enables an interactive way to learn the algorithm.
</li>
<li>
<b>Start the algorithm (<img src="../images/start.png">).</b><br>
After you have started the algorithm it is executed automatically. You can always pause (<img src="../images/pause.png">) or terminate (<img src="../images/stop.png">) the algorithm. Activate (<img src="../images/pause_before_stop.png">) so that the algorithm pauses before it terminates. This makes it possible to view the final visualization.
</li>
<li>
<b>Navigation</b><br>
You can navigate the algorithm during its execution. With (<img src="../images/prev_step.png">) you can go to the previous step and with (<img src="../images/next_step.png">) you can go to the next step. This makes it possible to repeat steps when the result is not yet comprehensible or skip steps that are already understood.
</li>
<li>
<b>Execution speed</b><br>
Each algorithm has a particular default execution speed that must not always be the same. You can slow down the execution (<img src="../images/slower.png">) or make it faster (<img src="../images/faster.png">) to find your individual workflow speed.
</li>
</ol>
<b>Tip</b>:<br>
Pay attention to extensions in the toolbar of LAVES (example: <img src="../images/toolbar_ext_example.png">). These extensions provide additional functionality to simplify the work with the algorithm.
<br><br>
<b>Hint</b>:<br>
The visualization of the algorithms is customizable. Go to the preferences to customize the visualization of the plugins. This makes it possible to set up the visualization on your needs.
