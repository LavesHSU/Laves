# Logistics Algorithms Visualization and Education Software

LAVES is an open source education software, that helps students understand the basic concepts of algorithms and supports the teaching staff visualize the dynamics of these concepts.

Using didactical methods, such as algorithm visualization in combination with exercises, LAVES facilitates the comprehension of the functionality of algorithms.

LAVES is available in German and English. It was originally developed to serve as an educational support tool for the lecture "Logistik" ("Logistics") in the Bachelor program "Wirtschaftsinformatik" ("Business Informatics") at the University of Siegen. It is possible, however, to extend or customize the software with own visualizations of algorithms that address the specific needs of other courses. Therefore, LAVES provides a Software Development Kit ([LAVESDK](https://github.com/LavesHSU/Laves-sdk)) which can be used to easily implement educational support for specific lectures.
